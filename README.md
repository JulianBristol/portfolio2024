## üé® Design Philosophy
I believe in creating designs that not only look visually appealing but also provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for all users. From concept to code, every detail matters which is why the bulk of this project was spent hashing out the design. This project was designed by me using mobile first development features, user experience testing (a.k.a asking friends to judge it and listening to their feedback), responsive design, accessibility-first design choices, and many more features

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Portfolio Showcase:** Highlighting my best projects with detailed case studies.

Special thanks to [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5oawMJaXbU&ab_channel=Hyperplexed) for his help and the inspiration on the text shuffle effect.
Thank you to [Manoela Ilic](https://tympanus.net/Development/OnScrollFilter/) for providing the inspiration for the distortion effect.

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
