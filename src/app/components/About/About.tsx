                        <p>Hey, Julian here!</p>
                        <p>As you can see, I really enjoy turning ideas into reality. My interest in web development started all the way back in 2006 where I was first introduced to MySpace&apos;s custom layouts. At the time, I didn&apos;t know what I was doing or even that I was using HTML and CSS. All I knew was &quot;this thingie does that thing &quot; ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<span>-Amazing, I know!</span></p>
                        <p>I think my time playing around in MySpace paid off. It seems that I&apos;ve passively absorbed many skills and tricks with CSS and HTML. When it came time to formally learn frontend development, the two languages came to me naturally. This allowed me to focus more on understanding JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>So far, I have had the privilege to collaborate with so many interesting and informative people across several companies and projects. I am happy to state that each interaction has taught me something not only about design, programming, and the development process, but also about myself. Now, I endeavor to find inspiration and learning from the unlikeliest of sources.</p>
